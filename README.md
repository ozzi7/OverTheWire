Solutions to exercises on OverTheWire.org


Note that there are (as of 2019) 630 repositories on github listing the solutions to these exercises. 
Hence keeping them secret makes no sense.

IMHO, it is better to look up a solution than to remain stuck forever on a level. After all, they are for educational purpose and there is nothing to be gained by cheating.
